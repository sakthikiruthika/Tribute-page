    <h2>Michael Joseph Jackson was born in Gary, Indiana, near Chicago, on August 29, 1958.<br> He was the eighth of ten children in the Jackson family, a working-class African-American family living in a two-bedroom house on Jackson Street.<br> His mother, Katherine Esther Jackson, played clarinet and piano, had aspired to be a country-and-western performer, and worked part-time at Sears.<br> She was a Jehovah's Witness. His father, Joseph Walter "Joe" Jackson, a former boxer, was a crane operator at U.S. <br> Steel and played guitar with a local rhythm and blues band, the Falcons, to supplement the family's income. Joe's great-grandfather, July "Jack" Gale, was a US Army scout; family lore held that he was also a Native American medicine man. <br> Michael grew up with three sisters (Rebbie, La Toya, and Janet) and five brothers (Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, and Randy).<br> A sixth brother, Marlon's twin Brandon, died shortly after birth.<br>

        In 1964, Michael and Marlon joined the Jackson Brothers—a band formed by their father which included Jackie, Tito, and Jermaine—as backup musicians playing congas and tambourine.<br> Michael said his father told him he had a "fat nose", and physically and emotionally abused him during rehearsals.<br> He recalled that Joe often sat in a chair with a belt in his hand as he and his siblings rehearsed, ready to punish any mistakes. Joe acknowledged that he regularly whipped Michael.<br> Katherine said that although whipping came to be considered abuse, it was a common way to discipline children when Michael was growing up.<br> Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon denied that their father was abusive and said that the whippings, which were harder on Michael because he was younger,<br> kept them disciplined and out of trouble. Jackson said his youth was lonely and isolated.<br> In 2018, Jackson's physician Conrad Murray said that Joe had chemically castrated Michael and forced him to undergo hormone treatment as a child to stop his voice changing.<br>
        
        Later in 1964, Michael began sharing lead vocals with Jermaine, and the group's name was changed to the Jackson 5.[29] In 1965, the group won a talent show; Michael performed the dance to Robert Parker's 1965 song "Barefootin'" and sang the Temptations' "My Girl".<br> From 1966 to 1968, the Jacksons 5 toured the Midwest; they frequently played at a string of black clubs known as the Chitlin' Circuit as the opening act for artists such as Sam & Dave, the O'Jays, Gladys Knight, and Etta James. The Jackson 5 also performed at clubs and cocktail lounges, where striptease shows were featured, and at local auditoriums and high school dances.<br> In August 1967, while touring the East Coast, they won a weekly amateur night concert at the Apollo Theater in Harlem.</h2>
